*learning how to create a local ai assistant using Python*

//Introduction
This project aims to create a local AI assistant using Python.
I thought it would be a fun and edcuational project to learn more about AI and how to implement it in a local enviroment.
The assistant will be able to perform various tass such as saving kanji and its meaning into a local database, retrieving kanji information.
